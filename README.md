# Symbols

[Symbols](http://csmgeo.csm.jmu.edu/Geollab/Whitmeyer/geode/symbols/) inputs a CSV file of structural data from field stations and outputs a Google Earth KML file with inclined orientation symbols. 3D symbols are positioned above the Google Earth landscape based on the parameters below. It is suggested that your CSV file has columns for each of the parameters below, but the only columns that are required are Latitude, Longitude, and Unit/Formation. Sample CSV file can be found in src/app/assets/test-data.csv
